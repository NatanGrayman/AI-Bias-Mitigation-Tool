# AI-Bias-Mitigation-Tool

## Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of the course ELEN4000A/4011A: Electrical Engineering Design II, one of the two 'capstone' courses in the BSc(Eng)  Honours Programme. The design project is a critical component of the program, emphasizing the synthesis of knowledge acquired throughout the degree to solve complex engineering problems and effectively communicate findings and their expected impacts.

The course aims to assess the capability of students to apply engineering knowledge and problem-solving skills using analysis, justifications, synthesis, and performance evaluation methods. It places significant emphasis on the social, economic, or environmental implications of projects, as well as sustainability.

### Importance of the Course

The capstone project is designed to challenge students to integrate and apply their cumulative knowledge to real-world engineering problems. Successful performance in this course demonstrates a student's ability to tackle complex issues, communicate their solutions effectively, and consider the broader impacts of their work.

### Choosing the Topic

I specifically chose the topic "AI for All - Building an Online Platform to Eliminate Bias" due to my keen interest in the ethical dimensions of AI. This interest was further cultivated through my elective course ELEN4019: Ethics, Ideology, and the Social Sciences. This course equipped me with the conceptual tools to identify ethical problems and address them systematically with arguments grounded in ethical theory. It also provided key perspectives and approaches from the social sciences to evaluate policy positions and theoretical arguments about desirability, social value, and societal impact.

### Project Achievement

In this project, I successfully designed an online platform aimed at eliminating bias in AI systems. The platform leverages advanced algorithms and techniques to identify and mitigate bias in datasets and models, ensuring fair and equitable AI outcomes. The project required a deep understanding of both technical and ethical aspects, combining my strong engineering background with the ethical frameworks learned in ELEN4019.

The repository also includes an essay from my ELEN4019 course, showcasing my ability to synthesize written communication with a strong engineering foundation. This essay provides further insight into the ethical considerations and theoretical underpinnings that guided the development of this project.

By incorporating both technical proficiency and ethical considerations, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to addressing one of the most pressing issues in modern AI development: bias and fairness.
